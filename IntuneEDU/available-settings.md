# Available settings for Intune for Education

Configuring settings is one of the key ways you can secure your Windows 10 devices and create the right kinds of access to enhance the learning experience. Intune for Education provides many settings that allow you to customize these experiences, both for individual groups and their subgroups.

Most settings are set up to either **Block** or **Allow** access to a certain device feature, where **Not configured** is the device's default setting or a user-chosen setting.

> [!NOTE]
> These user, app, and device settings differ from [tenant settings](what-are-tenants.md).

You can find these settings by first selecting a **group**, then choosing **Settings**.

Much of the information in the **What it does** column can also be found in the Intune for Education console; this format is designed to make it easier for you to search through the settings for specific items.
