## Confliciting settings in Intune for Education

It is possible to apply conflicting settings in the same group. When an attempt is made to apply these settings to a device or user, an error may occur. Errors are the result of the user or device being a member of multiple groups that have conflicting settings.

For example, Esperanza is a member of the *6th Grade* group and is also a member of group called *Earth Science*. If you configure a homepage setting and assign to *6th Grade*, and you configure a different homepage setting and assign it to *Earth Science*, she now has two conflicting homepage settings assigned to her. When you try to assign the settings to her, you'll receive an error. For more information about devices and users with settings errors see [settings errors report](what-are-reports.md).
