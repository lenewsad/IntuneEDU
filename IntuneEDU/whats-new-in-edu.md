# What's new in Intune for Education
Learn what’s new in this release of Intune for Education. You can also find out about upcoming changes that you should be planning for, as well as information about past releases.

## January 2018

### History of group actions taken by admins

You can now view a history of all actions taken by admins to change group admins, apps, and settings for their approved groups. You can find the log of this history in **Groups** > **Somewhere**.

### Windows Defender report

We've added a new report. On the Reports page, you can select **Defender** from the list of reports. This lets you view Windows Defender device health status for all your devices. You can see what this looks like in the [What are reports?](what-are-reports.md) doc.

### Use role-based access control to enable group admins

You can now choose groups of people to manage settings for other groups. For example, you could have a group called *High School Admins*, where the members are your team of admins for high schools in your district. The *High School Admins* group could be given permission to manage settings for groups of high school students. Find out more in the [groups doc](what-are-groups.md)

### User and device search

We've added two new options to the sidebar: **Users** and **Devices**. You can use these to search for individual users or devices, and quickly open the **Details** for these items. You can add these searches to the sidebar by **See all** > **Star button (Favorite)** to add them to your favorites list.

### Remote actions

You can now take remote actions on your users and devices. Select the device you want to take action on, then choose one of the following actions from the details page:

#### Devices

- Restart
- Reset to factory settings
- Sync
- Remove from management

#### Users

- Reset password

Find out more about [remote actions](remote-actions.md).

### Wi-Fi profiles

We've added a new option to the sidebar for **Wi-Fi profiles**. This lets you define Wi-Fi settings that you can assign to different devices, users, and groups.

## October 2017

### Dynamic groups

Define rules and we'll create groups that automatically populate based on them.

### New app status

When adding an app, you'll now see a per-device and per-user status of app installs.

### Updated details pages

Select a user or device in one of your groups. A pane will now slide up from the bottom of the screen that lets you get more information on that object, and the status of the apps and settings that you've assigned to it.

## May 2017 (initial release)

### Intune for Education is now available!

We have launched the Intune for Education portal. Intune for Education is a streamlined experience for schools and educational organizations to manage Windows 10 devices. Find out more about Intune for Education in these docs.
